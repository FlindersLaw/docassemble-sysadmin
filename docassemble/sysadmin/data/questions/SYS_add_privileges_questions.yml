question: Update User Privileges
subquestion: |
  This script reads all existing users and adds these additional privileges:
  
  - `llaw3301_2022_s1` (which is hard-wired into the code); and
  - their seminar number.
  
  The seminar number is extracted from a CSV export from FLO.  The topic identifier
  is hard-coded.  You need to change it in the main program.
  
  This code was written as a one-off as I forgot to add these extra privileges when
  I did the user account creation yesterday (25/2/20).
  
  Upload a CSV export of enrolled user data from FLO.
  
fields:
  - no label: csv_import
    datatype: file

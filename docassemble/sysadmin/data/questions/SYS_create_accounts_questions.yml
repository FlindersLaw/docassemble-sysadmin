  Dear ${ accounts_import[i].recipient }
  
  Welcome to *${ MJFtopic_name }.*
  
  As you know, you will be learning coding skills as part of this topic.
  In order to do this you need access to 
  [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org), which we will use to write our code,
  and [GitHub](https://github.com), which we will use to share code.

  The attached document contains your credentials to log into the
  [Flinders Docassemble Server](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au) and
  instructions for creating a GitHub account and connecting it to your
  Docassemble account.
  
  In order to access Docassemble and GitHub, you will need a computer with
  a modern web
  browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.
  Internet Explorer should not be used to access Docassemble (in fact, Internet
  Explorer should not be used for anything!).
  
  Make sure your web browser is up to date and has the latest updates installed.
  If you don't know what this means, please come and see me.

  As you will find out during the course, if you have any issues, it is up to you 
  to contact the Topic Co-ordinator.  So, if you have any problems accessing either
  Docassemble or GitHub, please contact me **as soon as possible**.  It's
  best to sort these problems out sooner rather than later.
 
  **DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL**
  as your reply will be lost.  Instead, look for my contact details in the Topic Guide.
  
  Wishing you all the best for this topic.  It's new, it's exciting and it's
  not as scary as you may think!

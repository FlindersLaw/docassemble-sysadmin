  Access credentials for LLAW3301 Law in a Digital Age

  Dear ${ MJFrecipient }
  
  Welcome to LLAW3301 Law in a Digital Age.
  
  This email contains instructions on how to access 
  [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org), which we will use to write our code,
  and [GitHub](https://github.com), which we will use to share code in our teams.

  ### Docassemble
  The table below contains the link to the Docassemble system and your
  access credentials.  You should change your password once you log in.  Refer
  to [this document](https://flo.flinders.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=2674336)
  for instructions.
  
  Docassemble server|https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au
  ---|---
  Login ID          |${ MJFrecipient.email }
  Password          |`${ MJFpassword }`
  
  ### GitHub
  
  You also need to sign up for a GitHub student account.  Please refer to
  [this document](https://flo.flinders.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=2674336)
  for instructions.
  
  In order to access Docassemble and GitHub, you will need a computer with
  a modern web
  browser, such as the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.
  Internet Explorer should not be used to access Docassemble (in fact, Internet
  Explorer should not be used for anything!).

  As you will find out during the course, if you have any issues, it is up to you 
  to contact the Topic Co-ordinator.  So, if you have any problems accessing either
  Docassemble or GitHub, please come and see me **as soon as possible**.  It's
  best to sort these problems out sooner rather than later.

  My contact details are in the Topic Guide.  My email address is
  [Mark Ferraretto](mailto:mark.ferraretto@flinders.edu.au).
  
  **DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL**
  as your reply will be lost.
  
  All the best

  Mark

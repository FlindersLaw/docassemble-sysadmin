# Code to import an excel spreadsheet into a DAList of dictionaries
#
# The spreadhseet to be imported is an Excel export of a Sharepoint
# Document library list.  It is expected to contain these fields:
# - Project Identifier
# - Project Description
# - Name
# The 'Name' column contains a hyperlink to the problem statement.
#
# Other Assumptions:
# - The Excel workbook contains only one sheet
# - The data starts from cell A1
# - The first row contains column headers
#
# These assumptions conform to the Problem Statement SharePoint
# list which should be configured as per this example:
# https://flinders.sharepoint.com/sites/LLAW3301_2020_S2/Problem%20Statements%20DL/Forms/AllItems.aspx

  The file to be imported should be an excel export of a SharePoint 
  list created using the 'Export to Excel' button on the SharePoint
  list itself.

  The Excel files should contain these columns.  If it does not, 
  then **the import will fail**.

  - Project Identifier
  - Project Description
  - Organisation
  - Name (which contains a hyperlink to the Problem Statement PDF)

  In addition:
  - The Excel spreadhseet should contain only one worksheet tab
  - The data should start in cell A1 (ie: the topmost left cell
    of the worksheet)

fields:
  - no label: ps_import
    datatype: file

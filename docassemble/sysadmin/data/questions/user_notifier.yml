  Docassemble server decommissioning
content: |
  Dear ${ first_name } ${ last_name },
  
  The Docassemble server [https://llaw3301.achelp.net](https://llaw3301.achelp.net)
  ('**Old Server**') 
  will be decommissioned on **March 2 2020**.  In its place we are commissioning
  a new Docassemble server 
  [https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au)
  ('**New Server**').
  The Old Server was run on my personal AWS account whereas the New Server 
  is managed by the University.  The new server also has much more capacity.

  You are being notified of this because you currently have an account on 
  the Old Server.  On March 2, the server will be shut down 
  and any content on the server will be destroyed.  It is up to you to make 
  any copies of code you would like to keep from this server.  Please note 
  that you may do so by creating a package containing your code and pushing 
  it up to GitHub.

  If you would like an account on the New Server please 
  let me know by sending an email to 
  [Mark Ferraretto](mailto:mark.ferraretto@flinders.edu.au).
  
  DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL
  as your reply will be lost.
  
  If you do not want
  an account on the new server you do not need to do anything.

  All the best

  Mark
